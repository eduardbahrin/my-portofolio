#my-portofolio

## Description
A project that is designed and working as a personal portofolio  to showcase things I learned while attending a Full-Stack Bootcamp
at University of Birmingham , United Kingdom.
This project is a simple three-section personal portofolio application.
The styling across the application was selected to match predefined mockups.
The application was built using HTML, CSS only.
